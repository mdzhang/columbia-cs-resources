Instructions

Write a series of programs using arrays and records that implement rudimentary playing card manipulations for the game of Hearts. Programs written should include NewDeck, Shuffle, Deal, Leader, and Show. 
    
NewDeck produces a deck of 52 cards and prints a string version of it onto stdout
    
Shuffle reads a string version of a deck of cards from stdin, recreates the deck, shuffles the deck, and writes the string version to stdout
    
Deal reads a string version of a deck of cards from stdin recreates the deck, and writes 4 separate 13-card decks (hands) in their string versions to stdout
    
Leader reads 4 hands from stdin (North, East, South, and West) and writes which hand contains the 2 of clubs to stdout
    
Show reads 4 hands from stdin and pretty-prints them to stdout

Examples:

% java hearts/NewDeck | java hearts/Shuffle | java hearts/Deal | java hearts/Leader

East

% java hearts/NewDeck | java hearts/Shuffle | java hearts/Deal | tee hands | java hearts/Show
