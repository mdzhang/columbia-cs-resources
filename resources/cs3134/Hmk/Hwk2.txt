Add the following methods to the Immutable List class (you may need some additional private methods as well):



public ImmutableList purge(); // returns a new list equivalent to "this" but with no duplicate elements



public ImmutableList sort(); // returns a new list made of the all elements of "this" but sorted. Must use merge sort algorithm.



Part 2.
Implement the class ListSet that uses ImmutableLists to implement the Set interface.

Part 3.
Write a driver class "ListSetTest" that functions as follows: On the command line, the arguments are a sequence of unsorted integers. The test class should first create an ImmutableList of the ints, then purge it, then sort it, then print it to stdout. Then, it should create a ListSet of the original ints and print it to stdout.



% java ListSetTest 4 8 5 2 9 7 5 6 9

ImmutableList is (2 4 5 6 7 8 9)

ListSet is { 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 }
