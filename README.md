# Columbia Undergraduate (Barnard, CC, GS) Computer Science Major

Courses I took, and related resources, for the computer science major I received from Barnard/Columbia from Fall 2011 through Spring 2015.

Available CS courses are listed [here](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/) along with the textbooks used by some of them. Generally, if you google a course, professor, and "columbia", you'll also find a bunch of public resources. Another way to see who taught what is by checking out [CULPA](http://www.culpa.info/).

See [guide](https://github.com/mdzhang/columbia-cs-resources/blob/master/Guide.pdf) to the CS major. This is a little different than the one I followed since they used to require both 1004 and 1007 which had to be taken sequentially.
