# Columbia Undergraduate CS Major

Stuff I studied in school (I graduated Spring 2015) for those interested in following the Columbia curriculum.

You can look at the texts for other CS courses [here](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/) if you click the term next to the Computer Science department's name. Hopefully they'll open the syllabi as well.

If you look up the professors for a course, and google them with Columbia, generally you'll find public resources. You can see what professors taught classes by checking out [CULPA](http://www.culpa.info/) too.
